# CircularDynamicArray Project

This Circular Dynamic Array in C++ offers a flexible and efficient data structure for managing dynamic datasets. It automatically adjusts its capacity, doubling when full and halving when sparse, ensuring optimal memory usage. Ideal for applications requiring circular, contiguous storage with dynamic resizing, this implementation showcases advanced programming skills and an understanding of efficient memory management in C++.
