# NBA Stats Predictor Project 

Developed and implemented a predictive model using Python's scikit-learn to forecast outcomes of NBA games based on historical data, featuring data preprocessing, feature engineering (including rolling averages), and Ridge Regression for improved prediction accuracy.
Applied advanced machine learning techniques including Sequential Feature Selection and Time Series Split for model validation, achieving robust performance metrics, and utilized Min-Max Scaling for feature normalization, demonstrating strong analytical and programming skills in data science.
